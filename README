rardetect
a simple rar detection tool
to compile, run
"gcc -o rardetect rardetect.c"
pretty simple, huh?
it's even simpler to use.
./rardetect picture.jpg
even simpler, right?
simply substitute picture.jpg with the name of any file that you think has a rar
known bugs: (I will not fix any of them, so just fork off if it bothers you (get it? I'm funny))
* will sometimes give false positives if files just happen to have rar headers
* will not find more rar files than just the first
* will not open rar files
* will not tell you the offset of the rar (I may fix this bug)
* does not brew coffee while you wait
* will not find rar files that have been obscured
